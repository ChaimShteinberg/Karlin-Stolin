      <p>
        Karlin-Stolin is a Hasidic dynasty, originating with Rebbe Aaron ben
        Jacob of Karlin in present-day Belarus, and later expanded to nearby
        Stolin. One of the first centres of Hasidim to be set up in Lithuania,
        many Lithuanian Hasidic groups are its offshoots. After the murder of
        many of its followers by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust, the dynasty
        continued to exist with followers in Israel, the United States, Russia,
        England, Canada, and Ukraine.
