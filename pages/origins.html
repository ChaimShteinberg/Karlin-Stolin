        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In the mid-18th century, a powerful spiritual revolution began to
          spread across Eastern Europe. Known as Hasidism, this movement brought
          a new focus on heartfelt prayer, joy, and deep connection with God.
          One of the first and most influential branches of Hasidism was founded
          in the town of Karlin, in present-day Belarus.

        <h3>Rabbi Aharon the Great of Karlin</h3>
        <p>
          The Karlin Hasidic dynasty was established by Rabbi Aharon ben Jacob
          of Karlin (1736–1772), known as Aharon HaGadol. He was a student of
          the Maggid of Mezeritch and was deeply influenced by the Baal Shem
          Tov. His prayers were fiery and full of emotion, and he attracted
          followers who wanted to serve God with intensity and awe.
